## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- Mobile-first workflow 

### What I learned
- The biggest challenge was the work with the image and recognition that sometimes you should not see the image as the 
  image but only as a padding of some other element.
- I am trying to get used to do a lighthouse audit and CSS Overvie (and fix the possible problems).
